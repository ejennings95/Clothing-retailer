# Tech test

In this project, I was tasked with developing a responsive website for a clothing retailer.

### Requirements

* There are discount vouchers available that can be redeemed (5 pounds - no conditions, 10 pounds - over 50 pounds in cart, 15 pounds - over 75 pounds in cart and a footwear item)
* The data is given to you rather than using a database:

#### Approach and structure of my code


#### Wireframes of class responsibility


#### Assumptions made from the requirements

- The final product should all be on one page
- It is important the website is responsive
- When an item is not available, it no longer appears in the list of stock on the website
- The strike out of one of the prices led me to think data needs to be changeable. Hence the default value of the stock
- The ability to purchase would be the next phase as it was not asked for
- No reference to multiple users, so there is no sign up, sign in, sign out. Therefore, the website is for one user at this moment.

#### Suggestions for the client


#### Screenshots of the final product


#### Run the program
